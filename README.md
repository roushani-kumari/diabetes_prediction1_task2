#  Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a part of my internship task where I built a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic health parameters.

## Project Objective

To train a machine learning classification model (Logistic Regression) using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and predict the likelihood of diabetes based on 8 medical features.

##  Tools and Libraries Used

- *Python* – Programming Language
- *Pandas* – Data manipulation and loading
- *NumPy* – Numerical operations
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* – Data visualization
- *Scikit-learn* – Machine learning (model training, evaluation, scaling)
- *Jupyter Notebook* – Code development and presentation
- *Pickle* – Model saving (serialization)

##  Features Used

- Pregnancies  
- Glucose  
- Blood Pressure  
- Skin Thickness  
- Insulin  
- BMI (Body Mass Index)  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Age
